“For households who struggle to maintain financial stability and forecast the future of their finances, Budge is a complete Financial software suite equip with tools to support families or collections of people with shared finances. Allowing multiple people to manage and visualize their finances in a shared area, allowing users in the group to spend money, add income and report on numerous key point indicators, an example being projected net worth. Allowing busy households to regain control of their finances and create concrete plans with appropriate data to support decisions and their feasibility.”

In summary the requirements hit five key areas: -
•	Income & Expenses
o	Users will track every aspect of their income and expenses along with the members of their group, allowing the users within a group to manage each other’s incomes and expenses too. Allowing detail such as the source, the amount and dates pertaining to the acquisition and ending of the income or expense.
o	With this data the user will be able to see visualisations of their incomes or expenses, one example is a line graph which allows the user to see the ebb and flow throughout the year with the highest point marked. The other example is a pie chart which maps the ‘active’ (active meaning it pertains to the current income or expenses as of the month in which the user is viewing) incomes or expenses allowing users within the group to quickly identify what aspects demand what percentage of their income or expenses (see Appendix B for examples of all visualisations).
•	Dashboard
o	The dashboard offers an over-arching view of the group’s finances. Using both the income and expense data, it gives a cashflow graph allowing users to quickly identify where in the year an income or expense might cause them issues and make informed decisions on how to action that.
o	Additionally, the dashboard has minimal versions of the income and expenses graphs shown on the other pages for a quick reference. The dashboard also has notifications/recent activity that live updates on any changes to incomes or expenses. (See Appendix C for examples of dashboard charts and notifications)
